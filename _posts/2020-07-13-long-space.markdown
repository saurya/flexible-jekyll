I play a lot of long games. I am patient and can defer reward from one particular venue in my life for quite some time hoping it fruits on its own. I am almost definitely a part of the [self-control elite](http://induecourse.ca/what-do-libertarians-and-pedophiles-have-in-common/) and I have the incredible fortune and privilege to think about how to play the next decade of my life rather than just the next week or next few hours. Once your basic needs are met, you start to pursue 'higher' goals. Higher is just another way of saying 'long-term'. I think anyone who reaches a certain level of security is incentivized to play long games.



But I think so many people are polluting the long game space.
