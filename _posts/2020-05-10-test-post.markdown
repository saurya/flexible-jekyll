I've been fairly anxious this weekend. We're supposed to hear back from Entrepreneur First as to whether we got our pre-seed funding soon. I am almost more nervous about getting it than I am about not getting it. Getting it would potentially put us on a fairly high-pressure track and I am not doing very well with pressure lately. I don't know if I ever really have, I tend to dissipate pressure into several different (creative) directions and a few unhealthy coping mechanisms like eating too much Maggi noodles or Bourbon cremes (childhood comfort foods) or watching the same shows or movies over and over again.

When I was going through a particularly tough time in August 2019, I watched Thor Ragnarok 15+ times. Recently I watched all of Community, even the loathsome Season 4 where Dan Harmon was missing as show creator and it really helped calm me down.

We're supposed to get a call to figure stuff out with the investors today. I am nervous/excited/anxious. Oof. I will feel much better after this bit is over.
