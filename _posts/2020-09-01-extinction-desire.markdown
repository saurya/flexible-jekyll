I don't want to want money. It's corrosive to the soul.

I don't want to want prestige. It's corrosive to my relationships with others.

I don't want to want comfort. It makes you soft.

I don't want to want to write this post.

What I want, really, truly, deeply want much of the time is to not want _anything_. I tell myself the broken world around me, the chaos and overwhelm that dominates my experience is a direct consequence of human desire. The desire to conquer, colonize, grow, earn, prosper. Rather than be content with what I have and draw boundaries with the overhwleming expression of someone else's desire, I deferred reward and deal with minor transgressions in search of something that will completely extinguish the expression of desire all around me.

I want to not want my exes. I think about KD and HZ a lot. Recency plays a role, as does tenure. I was with KD for nearly 5 years. Being with her and around her shaped a huge portion of who I am, or at the last awakened dormant ideas in my own mind. But it's been more than 4 years since the breakup and my rules-based congition says "You should be done with this by now." One way of being done with it is to just glom on to someone else new. I don't want to do this. Or, more accurately. I don't want to even have to solve this problem. I want this desire to simply disappear.

Sofia pointed out to me that my blog posting schedule has been overwhelming, to me as well as my dear readers! This too was motivated by my desire to extinguish something, to get to the next thing. I want to extinguish my desire to write. Write everything I have to write, say everything I have to say until I have nothing left in me. I want to be empty in the way that silence is the presence of everything. This is in some ways, moksha (nirvana).

Zen Koan about washing your bowl. It's about doing the ordinary things.

 I've become much more comfortable with desire recently. I eat not to remove all desire for food but merely to quiet it for some time.

I wanted to absorb KD and HZ and then once I was done with them, I was done forever. I guess this is why I miss them. The time when I was bonded and connected to them, I had desire and then once that desire was gone, the relationship ended, I tell myself I should not want them any more, but that's not the nature of desire. It comes back over and over and surprises you.

I left something out in my post on the lifecycles of a resource. The last phase of the life cycle of a resource is obsolescence. The resource is replaced by something else. In this way, this little lifecycle rhymes with the life cycle of desire. I see where it's all going and I want to short circuit the process that [I have seen so many times](seven stages of love in Arabic) - the inception, the infatuation, obsession and death. For resources, it would be discovery, refinement, ubiquity and obsolescence. There's this little cycle that repeats itself all across the structure of my universe which reminds me "it starts and it ends". I am the man running around a party knocking wine glasses out of people's hands "Don't you know, you'll have hangovers tomorrow?" The key lesson being, yes, of course we all know that but we still live today.
