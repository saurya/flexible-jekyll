I really, really love my journal. It started at the recommendation of my good friend [Sumita](//sumita.co) back in August of 2018. It starts with three questions ripped from the [School of Life's Philosophical Meditation](https://www.theschooloflife.com/thebookoflife/philosophical-meditation-2/). Opinions on de Botton aside (I have some vague sense in the back of my mind that he is either weird or problematic and I can't remember which, maybe both), the practice was small enough and compatible enough with what was going on in my life at the time that I just started doing it every day.

I spent about 6 months just rubbing away at the questions every morning:
What am I currently anxious about?
What am I upset about and with whom?
What am I currently excited or ambitious about (maybe learning)?

On July 4th 2019 something in me exploded and a lot of feelings came out - where I would normally write about 1-2 short paragraphs, I released a full page of text about how I was feeling. I had gotten so good at numbing, minimizing and suppressing my feelings it took 6+ months to awaken them finally and they were just raging and overwhelming. I was especially touchy the month of July and it blossomed into a very long (in retrospect obvious) anxiety attack. I made it through with a lot of help from my girlfriend and friends, alienating some people along the way.

My journaling still continues and I am easily producing 2-3 pages a day at this point, sometimes going back in the middle of the day to excitedly lay out my thoughts and wrestle/caress them in the safe space of my Google Doc. There are some days I have produced 9+ pages. The most marked consequence of all of this is that writing of any kind - fiction, non-fiction, WhatsApp messages has become incredibly easy. There is little to no friction between my mind and the medium. I hope to achieve even higher levels of fluidity and friction. I can see that there have been jumps in output as time goes on, 6 months the first time, another jump 1 year after that. Perhaps 2 years of journaling will result in an entirely different level of comfort with the practice of writing.

I had previously journaled when I lived in Boston, but it was almost always after my emotional health had been devastated, so I only knew how to write about unhappy situations and the very act of journaling had been associated with profound grief. I look back on those, often disjointed, shreds of a journal left behind from those times and see someone very different - someone very afraid of writing for fear of being found out for the things they thought. I think that fear has slowly receded as I repeat the practice.
