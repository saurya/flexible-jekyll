History cannot be taught or learned. It's felt and lived.

I was at the burial site of a Mughal king. Once in Lahore. Once in Delhi.

I was at the ruins in Tamil Nadu.

I went to see castles in Ukraine.

I rode camels in Mongolia.

Each book I read told me innumerable interesting facts, layed out scenarios in my mind of intrigue between palace guards and royals, the games of power people play. The sound of the crunch as my horse stepped on a sheep skull was different. I felt connected to the roll of history much more clearly. I too was part of the tumble. We are tempted to view history as something dead, but this is wrong. History is alive, and it is in us, it is taught to us in a way that imbues the present day with meaning.

I became very irate with Sameer for attempting to scratch a gem off of the tomb in Lahore. This was all that was left of millions of people laboring and believing in something greater than themselves. It was a reminder that things could be different, not better mind you, but different.

I cannot imagine that there are very many other things that can do the same thing.
