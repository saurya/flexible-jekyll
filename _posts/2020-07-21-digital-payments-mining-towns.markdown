The US dollar is actually a fairly recent currency for universal use within the United States. A significant portion of the taking of the American West by the expansion of Washington DC surrounded the breakup and dismantling of company towns. The company towns were autonomous collectives (ha!) owned entirely by a single company. The employees who lived and worked there were usually hours away, if not days away from the nearest representative of the federal government. The company towns had police, supermarkets, schools all run and owned by the company.

Employees would be paid in company scrip and would only be able to purchase goods at the company's stores within the company town. Naturally, in the middle of nowhere, people would want to get piss drunk, especially when their boss controls every aspect of their lives. The paternalistic company owners weren't having any of that, of course.

Control over currency is very important to states. As I talked about before in the nature of money, currency is tied to the power of the government. The United States Secret Service, descended from the Kingsguard is concerned with protecting two things - the office of the president and the money. Every coutnerfeit note is a federal crime because it threatens the state's power of monopoly over the trust in commerce.

Digital payments are fascinating in this context. Especially digital wallets. Stored value or credit with a particular company isn't illegal, but in Singapore one finds FavePay, AliPay, GrabPay and more of these options coming up every day. Governments are reluctant to miss out on the digital payments world since they legitiamtely fear what happened with company towns a hundred years ago. The method they want to use to keepthemselves safe is to partner, via the banks or get ahead of the problem by creating a payment system that uses their servers.

Geographical isolation was a big part of the company towns of yore, this is hard to do to the modern day urbanite. The far greater danger is a monopoly, or an ecosystem monopoly and fracturing. $10 in the Amazon ecosystem might get you far more than in the Microsoft ecosystem, and if your money isn't retrievable from one ecosystem into another, you could be in major trouble. The government could be in major trouble.

Additionally, comapny towns were risky since they offered so much that the state was also offering: postal service, police, etc. The real threat from digital wallets comes when people stop interacting with the state and primarily interact with their private ecosystem from which teir money doesn't move and finto which the government has little to no insight. 

China's economy today is nearly 40% dark to the communist party. This represents a big problem for Chinese officials who want to monitor criminal activity and anti-governemnt activity of any kind - they'd much prefer to have the levers of snooping in their hands rather than having to cave into the demadns of a large provdier like AliBaba or Tencent. For a country known for heavy handed state enterprises and intrusion it is ironically the private sector that made a name for China in the tech world. Neither AliBaba nor Tencent had help from the Chinese government prior to their phenomenal success. In fact, the payment wallets they provided to their users were originally investment accounts to invest in the companies themselves. Tencent and AliBaba were using their customers as their credit line. This of course pisses off the chinese government which wants to use its citizens savings as a credit line for itself.
