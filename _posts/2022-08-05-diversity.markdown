There's an [image floating around](https://twitter.com/Saurya/status/1114780030515666944/photo/1) the internet which ([among others](https://twitter.com/Saurya/status/1114780030515666944/photo/1)) shows the diverse colors of eyes and hair among European populations versus the rather uniform black/brown variation in Asian and African populations to show that it _true_ diversity is in Europe and not elsewhere.

This is so fascinating to unpack. For one, it shows the complete lack of knowledge of the full range of diversity in Asian and African populations. Africa is, like the urheimat of anything, more diverse in terms of human genetics than the rest of the planet combined. Everywhere else, humans experienced population bottlenecks that greatly reduced the genomic variety.

And yet! These outlying populations contain a fascinating amount of phenotypic variety. There are more genes for blond hair outside of Europe than within it. The Hmong people who range from central Asia down to Southeast Asia have one, the Solomon Islanders have another, and the trait has been observed in other isolated populations across the world, which likely developed the gene on their own.

The second presupposition in this diagram is that 



Here is a linguistic map of my [home state](https://twitter.com/Saurya/status/1215335107978022914) in India. The amount of linguistic diversity in one place boggles the mind. Europe simply does not compare on this axis.
