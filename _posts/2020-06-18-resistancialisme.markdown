I got into a drunken argument with this French guy at a party a few months ago - mostly because he was pissing me off for all sorts of other reasons - about the French resistance. I have a problem with [everyone-was-a-resister narratives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%C3%A9sistancialisme). Sorry, but no - if indeed everyone was a silent or active resister and objected to what the bad powers-that-be were doing, how did the 'bad guys' of history get their work done?

Even when the Allies invaded Germany and apprehended top officials in the Nazi administration, many people claimed they were secretly working to undermine the regime. I too, worked feverishly to undermine the grip of capitalism, wait till I tell the Communists lining up to shoot me when the revolution comes how long my bathroom breaks were.

Narratives about resistance and overthrowing an evil oppressor, painting ourselves as bold victims or fierce resisters strikes me as too convenient. It strikes me as especially convenient for European powers and America in WWII, since many of them had ideologies based on the [same science of race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Winston_Churchill), [early explicit financial support for the Nazis](https://time.com/5414055/american-nazi-sympathy-book/) and shame about the role of [national heroes who sided with the Nazis](https://www.salon.com/2018/12/30/best-of-2018-my-grandfather-wasnt-a-nazi-fighting-war-hero-he-was-a-brutal-collaborator/) against the Communists. The Nazis were not considered extreme in their views early on, since their plans for extermination only came to light after the war was over. Their rhetoric was considered acceptable and more over _revolutionary_ in post-WWI Europe.

Anti-semitism in Europe was hardly a new affair. In Eastern Europe you had the [pogroms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogrom). In Spain you have a town literally called ["Kill Jews"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/22/spanish-village-drops-kill-jews-name). In France, persecution of Jewish people goes back [1000 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_France#Persecutions_under_the_Capets_(987%E2%80%931137)). Similarly for [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_the_United_Kingdom#11th_to_13th_cent._Persecution_and_expulsion). The Nazis are a convenient Jungian [shadow projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology)) to avoid having to deal with the fact that any country in Europe could have birthed a movement like the Nazis.

Certainly, countries like France and the UK suffered during WWII, but nations are multifarious. Civilians who held no opinion on much of anything beyond their daily vittles took more of the brunt of the bombing campaigns than the abstract 'ideology' or 'nation' ever could. But that all the more underscores my belief that the war (like every war) was not one of clashing ideologies - of racial hierarchy against freedom and equality. France and the UK were running empires at that very moment, drawing soldiers and money from their holdings built on the very idea of racial hierarchy. The fight that France and the UK were involved in was one for survival, and perhaps there is nobility in that, but it is not some kind of philosophical pursuit of ideals that motivated the resistance effort. It does not deserve exemption from scrutiny. It does not deserve applause.

This is my core problem with the focus on the resistance of those nations, or even the story of resistance within India against British rule. Without Indian soldiers firing on civilians in Beijing, the British, German and Russian soldiers wouldn't have been able to commit the war crimes they did, particularly towards women. India made a token gesture by [returning a bell](https://apnews.com/089a817dfb0248639050ad901215c7c6) a British general stole during the Rebellion in 1994. Today's Indian and Pakistani army are direct descendants of the very same institution that the British founded - has there been a reckoning about this?

The more history I read, the more I am convinced that the world has always been kind of a mess. Power is never as powerful or as ubiquitous as you think, and far more cruel and vicious. Anyone who tries to portray themselves as having a clean history is lying to you, and even worse, lying to themselves. All our houses have a pox.
