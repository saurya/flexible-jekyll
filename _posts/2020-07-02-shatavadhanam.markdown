Shatavadhanam - my grandmother's uncle, Veluri Sivarama Sastry was born around 1900, I think, and when he was 10 years old he participated in a game that is a unique part of Telugu and Indian tradition.

It's essentially a 24-hour poetry jam with tons of interludes in between. The poet who is participating has a hundred questioners who ask him a question, the poet must compose a poem in response, but only reveal the first line befor emoving on thot henext quesitoner until he does this 4 times to completely give the whole verse. Once the whole verse is composed the poet must say the whole thing without missing a beat. Meanwhile, another quesioner wil interrupt the poet's flow and answers with new questions that are unrelated to the current context and the poet must answer, also with a rhyme from their last dropped syllable. 
The game is brilliant in the number of mental skills it tests - it is an incredibly imprtant part of the revival of Telugu literature and Indian natinoal identity within Telugu lands. Naturally, one starts by only having 4 questioners and scales up from there - ti takes a true prodigy to be able to play this at 10 years old and my grandmother's uncle was apaprently aone of those people - but he had quite a temper. The story that remains in the family to this day is as much abot his genius as his anger at being talked down to by adults after he had caompleted the exam and passed and had become the incredibly hard-to-achieve Shatavadahani. He apparently walked the 10 kilometers back home without breaking fast with the people at the contest since they had made fun of him, which feels like a pretty strong spiteful energy that at the very least, I seem to have inherited as well, if not for poetic ability.

It has elements that remind me of rap battles and chatushkas - often composing oetry is a folk tradition of the people at the periphery of political power. At the time of my grandmother's uncle Telugu people had no political representation  - kings were mostly Urdu-speaking, or Tamil-speaking.  While the literature was still patronized by these kings, it was often secondary and a far cry from the golden age of Telugu literature during the Vijayangara empire where outsider kings such as Krishnadevaraya were filled with praise for the language's poetic expressions and sought to compose some of the finest literature in Telugu.
