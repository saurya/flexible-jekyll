I use Pocket, which is a great little product, or it was the last time I used it several years ago. I still pay for Pocket premium because I have now gotten to the point financially where I can afford to forget about multiple $2/month subscriptions (see what I did there with the title?) and I tell myself I'll go back to read all those articles I hoarded at some point.

My pocket is mostly full of what I would call nerd shit, as opposed to cool shit. Nerd shit becomes cool shit after a lot of processing - it usually takes me a few hours of nerd shit before I stumble upon something legitimately very cool. I remember reading about linguistics for a long time before I found out about all the ways that principles of language overlap with biology, but that's for another article, one that I will never write.

Anything that takes more than a few minutes to consume on my Pocket is put off indefinitely. I engage with it almost as a chore now. I don't enjoy it! I open it up and see a bunch of things I meant to consume a long time ago and never got around to and they just hang there as grim reminders of my _lack of discipline and focus_. I then force feed myself the articles, loathe the experience and then avoid it altogether for a long time, building up ever more article debt.

Part of it though is also the sheer overwhelm of information. There are pieces of the world that I don't want to lose and so I hide them away in Pocket and wait to one day be completely isolated from the setthing mass of *Content* that the internet has become so I can consume in peace. My information diet is for a bulk, when maybe I should be cutting a bit more instead. Filtering out large swaths of information that are stored in my mind and are fed to me regularly that don't serve me very well - Simpsons quotes for example (jk, I will never let those go).
