There are a lot of places you can get free personal financial advice. Much of the conventional wisdom goes something like "Save for 6 months of expenses and then invest the rest."

There are subtleties to this of course. 6 months of leisurely life or just scraping by? Once I start investing, what should I save up to invest in - big stuff like real estate or stocks or bonds or Bitcoin?

I have a formula that has revealed itself to me over the years. I am more paranoid than most. I was expecting the world to end for quite some time now and was a bit peeved to see it happen 1 year after I left an extremely cushy job with a fantastic insurance plan. What the hell was I thinking. That said, I planned for 1 year's worth of savings. In the intervening year after I left Google I took up some small jobs here and there to supplement my savings and stem my burn rate.

After 1 year of savings, I invest in a bunch of stuff - bonds, stocks, etc. It doesn't really matter, in my opinion, to pick the right stocks. Pick some and be done. Some people will score big and others will not. In my opinion, finance is boring. Others [agree](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1269251364288258049). Observing and trying to beat the market is chasing after fool's gold.
