The idea of stuffing things into dough isn't _that complicated_. The Mongols have Khushuur, Georgians Khinkali, Chinese dumplings, Japanese gyoza. Within India, there are stuffed parathas, bondas, kachori and of course...samosa.

The best evidence we have suggests that the samosa came from Uzbekistan. Some say the Arab world. The samosa has spread far and wide - you can get Burmese variants in India and Burma. You can find Thai and Vietnamese versions in those countries respectively. Kenyans and Somalis have a version of the samosa as well (and the Kenyan doughnut - mandazi is also worth further...investigation).

To many people around the world, Indian food and samosas are synonymous. And that's fine, but it's not exactly accurate. India has always been a marketplace full of cultures.
