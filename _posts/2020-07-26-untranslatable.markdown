Wittgenstein, in his philosophy of language lays out his firm belief in the idea that there is not translatable phrase. Even from one person to another, we speak only in common referents so we can never be understood by the other. There are words and embodied feelings that can never meet. Yes, you may believe you convey the force and meaning of a word, but it's not the same.

Nevertheless, we persist and create shared meaning and bridges both physical and metaphorical despite the provable impossibility of the thing. The difference between a philosopher and an engineer.

There are some Telugu words that are embodied in this manner that I have never been able to fully convert into their English meaning.

Jila - a sense of irritating energy that something is left unfinished or undone.


Verri - an unexpected manic sense of hyper energy, usually arriving after a particularly good meal or good sleep

Chikaaku - irritation that feels like a blanket, such as that caused by heat

Visuku - irritation that's closer to being fed up, tired of the same old shit.

Thikka - a state of irritation, somewhat equivalent to waking up on the wrong side of the bed

Kopam - good old fashioned straightforward anger

Kasuru - 

Thitta
