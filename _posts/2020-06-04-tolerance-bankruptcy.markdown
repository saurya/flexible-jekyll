I love the idea of an ugh field (incidentally, a very hard thing to say when speaking since ugh is frequently an exclamation that stands on its own and not so much a frequent occurrence within sentences). Thinking of it as debt is also a bit interesting - if you're already in debt, additional debt accrual doesn't seem to matter as much as getting through the next few days. You would need a huge windfall of money to pay back enough of the principal of the debt for it to start affecting your life.

Distress tolerance seems to have a lot to do with success later on in life. But what if dealing with any mild distress is someone coming and asking you for a loan payment right now? On a tight emotional budget, you might not be able to afford that - and so one of two things happens. You find a way to squeeze in this additional incursion by tightening the belt - less emotional expression. Or you declare bankruptcy and begin detailing all of your assets and restructuring your life so that you can be free of this debt.

It might mean you lose a lot of your stuff, it might mean you have to give up certain habits that you've had for a long time. Heck, after paying all of it back you might realize that your entire relationship with money is different now, you don't want to accrue even a single cent of debt.

I am very wary of IQ tests and the like, partially because of EQ and this weird dichotomy that comes up between emotion and reason. Emotional intensity is often a pathway to high IQ skills - developing a strong feeling of comfort with a subject or space leads to huge advantages. Time spent on it doesn't feel like a chore, it feels like love. You start to develop skills and insights beyond what others can. Losing this sense of love for a field when you once loved it can be very jarring - as happened to me when I got so sick of technology and working on tech things that I basically don't code any more.
