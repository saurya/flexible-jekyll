Coke Studio is one of the easiest ways to get a [bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElbIce8KrAw) of [great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrPvQvbp3Cg) [music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReY3YSltJek) into [your life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7tsJ8-JdH8). The performances are lively and entertaining, the music is often popular stuff from a previous generation reimagined with really good recording equipment and incredibly talented singers. Nescafe had to compete with Coke and launched [Nescafe Basement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmErtNSs5ak) in Pakistan, while Coke Studio expanded to other parts of the world [like Algeria](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjffcVPr6FF-fELpvLO5dNQ). I will forever be grateful to Coke Studio for introducing me to the treasure that is Qurat-ul-ain Baloch in 2016.

Qurat-ul-ain's biggest draw is her incredibly rich voice. There's something of substance, like the husk of wheat or bark of a tree in the way she lets her energy flow. It comes from deep inside her and my soul shakes to hear her. [Nirmal Roy in Ala Baali](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guFLjEsg1kc) has a beautiful voice. [Shilpa Rao in Paar Channa De](https://youtu.be/TrPvQvbp3Cg?t=322) can make you cry with her silky, solemn rendering of the lovers' fate. [Momina Mustehsan...showed up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7tsJ8-JdH8). I find RFAK's voice to be powerful but kind of...steely. Something reminiscent of a clanging spoon in his work. QB is different. There is no other Coke Studio Pakistan singer who comes close to QB's level, in my opinion.

Umair Jaswal tries to steal the spotlight in [every Coke Studio song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YahQn3RJMAg) he shows up in, and he's handsome and full of life and performance but QB so effortlessly takes all the breath in the room with her soulful rendering of the traditional Saraiki [Sammi Meri Waar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHLNSxe5Y8A). Umair looks like he's having the time of his life up there singing, which is great, but totally not in keeping with the tone of the song! QB meanwhile nails the tone so...just. Ugh. Perfect.

She has singles as well - [Bewafaiyaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kY5tyrdMh8) has an almost Spanish classical intro which is like catnip for me. Her voice again is the real selling point - thicc, like undiluted Vietnamese coffee. Or check out the [music video for Saiyaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETk1EHgnmWI) which made me want to visit Pakistan back in 2016 more than any tourism ad ever could.

Lest you think she only has a morose register - perish the thought. Hear her voice as she sings about how she makes an excuse about bringing roti to see her beloved [colourful turban man](https://youtu.be/xhgt47nvZUQ?t=296).

Anyway, have my babies, QB.
