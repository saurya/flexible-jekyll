I don't remember where I read the original piece about Odisha's fantastic cyclone management policy but this article covers [the basics]. One of the poorest Indian states with a population of 46 million, and an average daily income <$5 was hit with a terrible cyclone 20 years ago that killed 10,000 people. The state was devastated but enterprising administrators created a set of plans, procedures and infrastructure under a "zero casualty" policy. They didn't want to lose a single person during a cyclone.

Fani in 2019 didn't quite achieve the goal, but it seems 64 people had lost their lives. In comparison to the situation 20 years ago, that's a phenomenal success, especially given the tight budgets that the state government had to work with.

>A record 1.2m people (equal to the population of Mauritius) were evacuated in less than 48 hours, and almost 7,000 kitchens, catering to 9,000 shelters, were made functional overnight. This mammoth exercise involved more than 45,000 volunteers.

Capacity-building approaches to states clearly seem to have worked well in Odisha, and people seem to trust the rule of law enough that they follow evacuation orders and know they can come back to their property. In my trip to Odisha in 2017, I remember being most struck by the stark difference as the train crosses the border from Andhra to Odisha. Ruined houses, abandoned farms replaced the lively fields and tightly bundled village centers around the train stations. I imagined that there must be a lot more going on than what I was seeing in front of me - and our school visit centered around a [non-profit organization](https://www.gramvikas.org/) founded by an [activist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Madiath) who fought for tribal rights in the 1970s was truly eye-opening in many ways.

India has another bootstrapped and silent success story in public disaster management - HIV/AIDS. This article dives into it in much [more detail](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/13/the-untold-story-of-how-india-sex-workers-prevented-an-aids-epidemic-ashok-alexander-a-stranger-truth). The summary is that India's organized sex workers were able to enforce condom use and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS. The book based on this remarkable bottom-up effort is right called _A Stranger Truth_.

This was not even a success of capacity-building, especially not on the side of the state, but it was a success of community organizing. These examples are fascinating as they stand in contrast to China's approach to tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic which was exacerbated by some [unique phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_Economy).

India now sits and waits for the death toll to come in for an epidemic and another cyclone. For now, it seems the numbers are low for Cyclone Amphan, let's hope it stays that way.
