I didn't know much Hindi when I arrived at university where most of the South Asian community spoke it at least somewhat. During high school my family was 100% focused on getting my English real good so I can get that bread later on in life. At home we even stopped speaking Telugu, which was uncomfortable for my mom. We even dropped any pretense of watching Indian movies - Hindi or Telugu.

During college I barely had the time to learn languages since computer science was kicking my ass every semester. Frankly, in college I barely had the space to breathe until perhaps end of junior year, but that's for another post, one that I'll never write. I only picked up Hindi 'really' once I started taking classes in Boston around 2014. I had deep down resolved to go back to India one day, and to be prepared to do it alone since I didn't really want to experience it through the eyes of my parents for the first time after 18 years. I re-taught myself the Telugu script my first year out of university. I had this feeling that "Now that I got the prize - the Google job - I can go and build all the other pieces of my life." - a feeling that still persists.

Devanagari script has a lot of recognizable similarities to Telugu if you're paying close attention - the ligature mark (the one on the bottom) for 'l' in Telugu (ట్ల ) looks a lot like the 'l' character in Hindi (ल). This didn't make Devanagari that much easier though, to be clear. I still can only read it haltingly and with lots of context clues.

Hindi grammatical structures often mimic ones in Telugu perhaps because Dravidian languages were [the substrate for Indo-Aryan ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substratum_in_Vedic_Sanskrit) or perhaps because of India being a [linguistic area](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/410649.pdf). The most common ones that mess me up are post-positions, like prepositions in English, but after the word instead of before. Both Telugu and Hindi use post-positions. Rather than saying "on the table", the construction would look more like "table on". But Hindi post-positions are [false friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend) with Telugu ones - ki, ko, ku mean related but different things in the two languages and I almost always default to using them the Telugu way. Turns out this is one of the main features of Dakhni, a dialect of Hindi/Urdu native to...my [home city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad). Many Dakhni speakers likely developed the dialect by first speaking Telugu, then learning Urdu and defaulting to [Telugu semantics](https://twitter.com/TianChengWen/status/1062211681571397632?s=19) in the absence of corrective authority.

Vocabulary can sometimes be easier than expected since Hyderabadi Telugu, in particular my mom's, uses many Urdu/Hindi words in place of Telugu ones. Even common phrases all over the Telugu-speaking regions such as 'parwah le' (no worries) are partially Urdu - parwah is the Urdu word for worry. I've still yet to dedicate the time to learn vocab in a structured way, but in common parlance it is often good enough to just drop in an English word like office. Or I sometimes take the Telugu word and drop a syllable or two (aksharamu -> askhar), it seems to work out OK!

The biggest struggle for me though is understanding people - official announcements at a slow pace are perfectly fine. Once we get into common interactions, even with taxi drivers, I start to get lost. Practice is hard since there are so many other things to do in life, and truly with infinite time, I would just want to learn all the languages. It's like putting a puzzle together. For now, I think I'll just stick to struggling with YouTube videos every other week.
