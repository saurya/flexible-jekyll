I read a lot of Twitter every day, and my meta cognition kicks in and starts noticing why I'm going to Twitter.

When I play the Witcher, I feel this obsessive need to finish every single side quest and question mark on the map.

When I'm at a party, I feel this urge to talk to every single person.

At home on a Saturday night, even if my body desperately needs rest, I still tell myself I have to go out somehow.

Underlying all of this is an anxiety that I am not optimizing to get the most out of life. Whatever is in front of me, I have to squeeze the most joy out of it and in doing so, I squeeze all the joy out of it.
