The platonic idea of a mango, a tomato, hides the diversity. Abstractions that help us navigate the world also hide much of its beauty from us. We only have time to break out of the abstractions when its causing a problem for us.

But some problems are so hidden away that we cannot actually take them seriously until we fix them and see the world is much better for it.
