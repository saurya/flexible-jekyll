The phospholiipid bilayer is a massive innovation in biology that allowed organisms as they are to form. The layer has two key components: a hydrophilic (water-loving) part, phospho- and a hydrophobic (water-hating) part, -lipid.

Lipids are just fats, oils, and as anyone who has seen a bowl of soup or ramen or a puddle of rain on the side of a road can tell you - lipids reject water. Perhaps more importantly, they stick to each other. These fats bond pairwise with each other and then chain together, creating a thin sheet. Sometimes they form a little bubble. Turns out, we're all descended from what amount to little oil bubbles. The chemistry of the phospholipid bilayer proffers a particular advantage - oil bubbles have to be air inside, they cannot hold water. A phospholipid bilayer can.

This is the very first boundary that we would recognize in biology. There is an inside and an outside, which allows things to grow on the inside which are vulnerable to outside forces during their nascent stage. The boundary also allows for a different environment inside, one that removes elements of the outside that are noxious to the things we want to grow within. The mechanism responsible for this is the immune system.

A filter at the boundary and a sy
