I love finding out that some piece of music I can't get out of my head turns out to be vaguely Indian in origin. It's a happy little coincidence and also a reaffirmation that I love the familiar. Or maybe, as Hannia used to put it, I have an India fetish. Not wrong tbh.

This is an oldie - a British song based on a Russian song:
[Those were the days my friend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QptZ8tYZAkE). The original [Russian version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr5y3keT1Mg) is based off of a Gypsy song. And of course where in the world are the Roma from? India! This is perhaps why I also like Bebo & Cigala's version of [Lagrimas Negras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnc7Bz57CME) (introduced to me by the swole [Pablo](//morepablo.com)) - El Cigala is Romani.

The guitar at the beginning of the [James Bond Theme song](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_Theme#Authorship_and_origin) was originally composed for an Indian setting and shares the same musical raga as....Britney Spears' [Toxic](https://youtu.be/cj6CDicY3NM).

Lest you think this borrowing from India is strictly the domain of white music - my sister remembered this very [addictive song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bnc7Bz57CME), which has an intro and fade in that slaps. And of course who could forget will.i.am's [version of Urvasi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuM7hObGjWI). The [original](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vkRRYMlmuo) is a childhood favorite and also _fucking slaps_. Prabhudeva is a fantastic dancer and I've heard the song in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi so many times I get the lyrics mixed up all the time.

>Chitrahar mein bijli udd gaye (Hindi, _the cinema hall loses electricity_)
>
>Take it easy policy
>
>Baga chadivi fail aipothe (Telugu, _study hard and you still fail_)
>
>Take it easy policy
>Valukka thalaiyan thirupathi pona (Tamil, _you go to Tirupati with a bald head_)

Tirupati is a pilgrimage site in Andhra where folks typically go to get their hair shorn off.

Meanwhile, I'm just sitting here waiting for the [Busta Rhymes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7FfCJb8JZQ)-[Manohara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6RrZJAa-fvQ) mashup.
