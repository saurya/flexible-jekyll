If you speak Arabic in Morocco, and everyone understands you perfectly, then you go a bit east to Algeria, where they also speak Arabic, what do you think would happen? You'd expect everyone to understand you, but things get a little funky - you won't understand everything. You go a bit further east to Egypt and now it seems like you can only catch a few words. You go further east to Yemen, and you simply cannot understand a thing.

You're a bird in the arctic. You live in Norway, and one day you fly east to Sweden and see a very beautiful bird. The two of you spend a season raising a brood. "Hmm" you say. "I wonder if the birds are just more handsome as you go east. Let me see." So you intrepid Norwegian pecker you, flap your way to Finland where you see a very beautiful bird and spend a season raising a brood. The next season you make your way over to meet your Russian soulmate and after a feather-y dust-up the two of you assume a brood is on the way. But it never comes. You see a Finn fly over and rush off with your Russian soulmate, and this season they raise a healthy brood together while you subsist on kasha and vodka.

There's a shiny axe that sits in a museum. Its label reads "Abraham Lincoln's axe". The original axe was interred in this mausoleum of things in 1872. A few years later the handle began to rot and a diligent curator found the same forest from which the wood was drawn to replace it. In the early 1900s the blade began to wither and rust, so another diligent curator found a smithy that could replicate it exactly. The string that held axe to blade rotted away over the years and it too was replaced with utmost attention to detail. Today, can anyone see Lincoln's axe?

These three examples highlight a really important part of education to me - we start with extremely rough categories. "Birds" - all birds are the same. "Arabic" - everyone who speaks Arabic understands each other. As we progress in our learning through a subject we realize that the earlier classifications were conveniences. Discrete taxonomies are easy to visualize and understand but they are a coarse filter on the underlying continuum of reality. We classify bison and cattle in different species, and for that matter in different genus(es?). Yet they can create viable offspring together. We categorize all the Kurdish dialects together as one Kurdish language, but they are mostly unintelligible with each other. Meanwhile we categorize Serbian and Croatian as separate languages when in reality they are essentially the same language.

Whenever we try to simplify and communicate about the world we do so with disrupted continua. We try to speak of the center of clusters rather than the wide distribution of them.

I have a lot of thoughts about what a world that doesn't do that looks like, and I think it doesn't include national-scale education systems. Educational writing follows the [Pyramid Principle](https://medium.com/lessons-from-mckinsey/the-pyramid-principle-f0885dd3c5c7) and the top of the pyramid has to carry all the assumptions in it.
