Nucleya's Akkad Bakkad was probably my first desi dubstep experience all those years ago. Since then, Nucleya has had quite an illustrious career working with a lot of famous names as well as indie musicians.

[Bass Rani] is quite good, as is [Heer], a poem based off of one of the four romances of Punjab. If you want a real tear-jerker for ~10 minutes listen to [this rendition](Paar Channa De) of [another of the four tragic romances of Punjab](link to Soni mahiwal wiki).

Nucleya collaborated with a Tamil folk artist, Chinna Ponnu whose [Sendhura Pottuvatchu] is also a song I've put 100+ listens into. She's something of an icon in Tamil music land.

Ritviz dabbles in some electronic sounds, but is a bit of a stretch to call dubstep. Still has plenty of enjoyable tracks, including this very cute video with some uncles dancing.

SomeWhatSuper is a Pakistani duo who tear it up with pretty much everything they release. Bandook() _fucking slaps_. Sher-e-Balochistan _also slaps hard_.

Bollywood has taken the step towards much more wub wub - remixing the classic Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast Mast, the 'original' iconic for both Akshay Kumar's hypnotic gyration and the fact that it was a melody copy of the Nusrat classic about a Sufi saint. Nowadays a lot of songs feature some electronic drop and honestly I'm too old to figure out if that means it is dubstep or deep house or whatever.

Overall, I have a soft spot for soft vocals + dubstep. Something about the pacing of SomeWhatSuper's [Uth Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJj5bONlYZ0) is just pregnant with tension. It's done really well and I've listened 100+ times, easily. I eagerly await for the next thali of desi dubstep for me to gorge myself on.
