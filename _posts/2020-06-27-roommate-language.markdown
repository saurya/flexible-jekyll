My roommate claims he speaks Kannada - and truly when he converses with his friends I cannot decipher even a word of what they say. However, when he talks to his mom much of his speech is intelligible to me. It does sound like he has a bit of a different accent than say..how my mom speaks. Ithen hear his mom and I hear her speech very clearly similar to my mom's.His family is telugu at some point, moving to Bangalore a few generations ago.

Bangalore is just that kind of city - ther eare varieties of Dakhni, a dialect of Urdu native to Hyderabad and its surrounding regions because of migrants from Hyderabad years ago. Bangalore is a cosmopolitan city in terms of languages and has been since its founding.

The city used to boast some 300 lakes and easily 10+languages spoken there. Now the number of languages is probably close to 30+ and the nubmber of lakes <100 - a rapid sign of how India's cities are urbanizing and nationalizing.

This however causes a lot of interesting categorization problems. Does my roommate speak Kannada, is he Kannada? Is his family Kannada? The relationship between Telugu adn Kannada as languages is also pretty long and enmeshed. Telugu script is an adaptation of Kannada script, while the language itself split off from Kannada and the other South Indian languages at a much earlier time.

There exist lots of people who speak the way Shashank does - A form of Kannada-ized Telugu at home and a very Bangalore Kannad ain the streets -one that would be understandable to people from the north of Karnataka but those people would be very hard to decipher for my roommate. 

These little funny stories of language pervade the Indian subcontinent - one-way understanding, overlapping words and misuse of registers. The more I learn about Indian languages, especially from the brilliant TianChangWen on Twitter, the more the layer of reality and social relations and history becomes clear to me. It's addicting.

Lngsuitics as a dsicpline is so robust that it has been backed up by nearly every other field - once they've caught up. Archaeology, population genetics, even historical records seem to give us confidence that the study of human languaege is one of the hardest of hard sciences and has given more than its share back to our understanding of ourselves.

Is my roommate Kannada or Telugu?He identifies as Kannada. Is his language Kannada or Telugu? When I understand it, I think it is KTelugu. When I don't it is Kannada. It mighta ctually be something else entirely in a few years.
