There's this great question on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-the-USA-look-like-the-largest-economy-in-the-world-when-I-travel-there-Chinas-top-cities-look-even-more-advanced-than-American), which is mostly the platform to ask leading questions that get dunked on these days than anything else. The question has a funny presumption - that the skyline picture of a place is a mark of advancement. It's a particular type of nerd who fantasizes about Blade Runner Hong Kong and believes we haven't achieved the flying cars on Mars future yet because of [silly naming](https://twitter.com/MimeticValue/status/1260252691902726153?s=20).

I think it's the same type of nerdery that gets swept up in appreciating China's progress because of its skyscrapers. What's measured is managed, and a skyline picture that includes a couple of skyscrapers advertises to a lot of people that you can build big thing. In China, the mega-civil-engineering project seems to be what advertises modernity. It is probably how regional heads of China tell each other that they're doing well. I see it as some sort of game that the mayors of these places have to play with each other.

Singapore meanwhile has to play this game against Hong Kong and Dubai - how to get the most money in per square meter of office space. Skyscrapers make sense here. Many of the public utilities in Singapore are more advanced than what you'll see in any part of the West (at least the parts I have been to). Yet the public discourse here involves statements like [this one](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/tommy-koh-laments-that-singapore-is-a-first-world-country-with-third-world-citizens). Skipping the whole origin of the third world and how that's become conflated with third-rate in common language, it's interesting to note that this professor thinks that the average Singaporean isn't as 'modern' as he believe they need to be.

What is this mythical modern mindset that this person wants? What, beyond aesthetics, is modernity actually? What is this [primal beastliness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneer_theory) that seems to come out in the way that 'modern' people grab for themselves?

I think it's best to start at a lower level of organization than Nation. For most of history, the family is the most important part of your survival. If you wanted to eat, sleep and procreate in peace, you need a good relationship with your family. You play infinite games of prisoner's dilemma with your family. Your family's standing determines how well you can do those things. We then clumped together into larger units, tribes, which consist of many families. And clumped further and further until we had groups of now millions of beings who had all tied their fate and brand name together, playing infinite games of prisoner's dilemma with each other.

Once we reach that really large group, aesthetics matter quite a bit more than reality. Aesthetics matter much more once you're beyond the zone of easy trust. This is maybe what modernity really is about - just aesthetics. Cities in China have to signal their modern aesthetic. Companies have to signal their cool aesthetic. Real betterment of the human condition and human experience? A happy occasional side effect to all of this.
