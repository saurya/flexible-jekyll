I didn't think it was possible to be bad at relaxing. I assumed relaxation was the default state for the human mind and it needs to be constantly whipped away from distractions and into the current moment to focus on the task at hand. This couldn't be further from the truth. Relaxation is a honed skill, and I am _very_ jealous of those who can drop into it without aid.

I was once talking to my friend Nick about meditation practice...7 years ago. "I once tried meditating and I just looked at the wall and before I knew it 25 minutes had passed." The sheer jealousy I felt! I had been practicing meditating for a year at the point and had nothing close to that kind of ability to drop into a less aware mental state.

There was even a time that I thought my racing thoughts and hyper-vigilance were not just a sign of my *INCREDIBLE* intelligence but rather that they were the core of it. If I let go of those things, I would lose what gave me value and the lifestyle that my family had been working for since we came to America. I didn't realize then that those were symptoms of anxiety - I was young, healthy and didn't drink caffeine, so anxiety didn't seem like a good fit. I remember being overly concerned with how much I was burping in 2011 and I went to a doctor. "Listen, there's nothing wrong with you but you need to relax."

Hearing someone tell you to relax does one of two things: it relaxes you or it infuriates you. If you don't have the skills to self-soothe, you will simply be infuriated by everyone's entreaties to chill. If you do know how to relax _and_ you trust the person saying it to you - e.g. a voice in a meditation session you intentionally tuned into - this is actually a really useful phrase.

I've been cultivating things to help me intentionally relax - candles are helpful (even when they accidentally start mini disasters). I've been working through a lot of sessions on Calm and I often feel hyper sensitive to the world afterwards. The hyper sensitivity does not help me navigate the world better and results in me feeling a bit ashamed that I cannot take even going outside into the light. Even exercises that help me relax my jaw, or self-massage go a long way towards relaxing the body. The mind usually follows suit after. A lot has been written about the way the body and mind relate to each other and I won't go into that now, but I definitely find that relaxing the body is a cheat code that stops all the anxious thoughts. Or maybe it's just a distraction. Either way, paying attention to the body in all the little ways is a nice big red intentional rest button.
