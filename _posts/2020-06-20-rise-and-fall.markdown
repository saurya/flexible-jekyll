Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, PM of the UAE and emir of Dubai was once quoted saying:
> My grandfather rode a camel, my father rode a camel, I drive a Mercedes, my son drives a Land Rover, his son will drive a Land Rover, but his son will ride a camel

And in a somewhat similar vein, Einstein was once quoted as saying:
>I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.

And in another, somewhat similar vein, a German politician said:
>In Germany, it is expected that the plumber’s taxes pay for a doctor’s education. The plumber is the parent and the medical student is the child.

Three different visions of how we can expect the future to play out - Einstein was privy to the knowledge of how humanity was knocking at death’s door. Al Maktoum was sensitive to the non-renewable nature of Dubai’s oil wealth - and the German politician focuses on a vision of collective investment in the future via individual progress. A society is sustained in its progress when a parent can unlock opportunities of prestige unavailable to themselves.

I don’t think it likely that we will blow ourselves to bits - warriors tend to lose their fervor over time. History is littered with conquerors who sit down to govern and just go _oh shit this is a lot of paperwork_. Humans as a race are tired of conquest, though we’re not above a rational pursuit of national self interest. This, in our incredibly connected economy though, means that nations cannot pull off very much without risking alienation or at least a weakening in their bargaining power. I think we can leave Einstein’s fear behind.

However, Al Maktoum’s prediction is probably going to apply to many, many regions of the world that are currently seeing a boom. This is in some ways just the rhythm of things - rise and fall. A great visualization of this charts the rise and fall of the world's [10 most populous cities](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-most-populous-cities-500-years-history/). The citties falling off the chart are often not just slowing down in their growth - they are reversing. There are very few parts of the world that have arrived at some number of people and just kept it there for a few decades.

I watched a series of lectures on [capitalism from Yale](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2497FD1251EED4DD) back in 2014ish which introduced me to the concept of an 'ever-reinventing order'. We've built systems that are capable of looking at and measuring themselves, much the way Sheikh Rashid did. However, it remains to be seen if this will actually help us prevent our collapse.
