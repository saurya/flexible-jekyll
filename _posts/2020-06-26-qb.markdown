Qurat-ul-ain's biggest draw for me is her rich voice. There's something of substance, like the husk of wheat or bark of a tree in the way she lets her energy flow.

Umair Jaswal tries to steal the spotlight in every Coke Studio song he shows up in, but QB so effortlessly steals all the breath in the room with her soulful rendering of the traditional Saraiki [Sammi Meri Waar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHLNSxe5Y8A). Seriously, Umair looks like he's having the time of his life up there singing, which is great, but totally not in keeping with the tone of the song! QB meanwhile nails the tone so...just. Ugh.

She has singles as well - [Bewafaiyaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kY5tyrdMh8) has an almost Spanish classical intro which is like catnip for me. Her voice again is the real selling point - thicc, like undiluted Vietnamese coffee.

Lest you think she only has a morose register - perish the thought. Hear her voice as she sings about how she makes an excuse of bringing roti to see her beloved [colourful turban man](https://youtu.be/xhgt47nvZUQ?t=296).
