There's a Muslim punk rock band covered in the documentary Taqwacore called Noble Drew. They have a song that is quite entertaining. Their name is a reference to a black American who adopted Islam and brought it to help the communities of his neighborhood in the US.

SImilarly, the Nation of Islam adopted some principles and symbolism from Islam to develop itself into a very different beast of its own.

The one that always blows my mind is Rastafarianism. Ras-ta-fari is a reference to the king of Ethiopia Haile Selassie. Jamaicans believed that he was the second coming of Christ, something that came as much of a surprise to him when he landed in Jamaica. Rastas combined the dreads, vegetarianism and marijuana smoking habits of Hindu ascetics, whose cultural elements were brought over by indentured servants.
