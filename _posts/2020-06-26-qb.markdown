Coke Studio is one of the best ways to get a bunch of great music into your head. The performances are lively and entertaining, the music is often popular stuff from a previous generation reimagined with really good recording equipment and incredibly talented singers. Nescafe had to compete with Coke and launched Nescafe Basement in Pakistan, while Coke Studio expanded to other parts of the world like Algeria. I will forever be grateful to Coke Studio for introducing me to Qurat-ul-ain Baloch.

Qurat-ul-ain's biggest draw is her incredibly rich voice. There's something of substance, like the husk of wheat or bark of a tree in the way she lets her energy flow.

Umair Jaswal tries to steal the spotlight in every Coke Studio song he shows up in, but QB so effortlessly takes all the breath in the room with her soulful rendering of the traditional Saraiki [Sammi Meri Waar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHLNSxe5Y8A). Seriously, Umair looks like he's having the time of his life up there singing, which is great, but totally not in keeping with the tone of the song! QB meanwhile nails the tone so...just. Ugh. Perfect.

She has singles as well - [Bewafaiyaan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kY5tyrdMh8) has an almost Spanish classical intro which is like catnip for me. Her voice again is the real selling point - thicc, like undiluted Vietnamese coffee.

Lest you think she only has a morose register - perish the thought. Hear her voice as she sings about how she makes an excuse about bringing roti to see her beloved [colourful turban man](https://youtu.be/xhgt47nvZUQ?t=296).

Anyway, have my babies QB.
