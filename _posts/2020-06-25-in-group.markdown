[Olivia's](//oliviachi.com) job market paper [A Classroom Observer Like Me](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vke9l6mtl5hmqqk/Chi%20JMP%20201910.pdf?dl=0) shows that if a teacher's rater is the same demographic as the teacher, they tend to give higher ratings. Classic in-group bias that shows we should take ratings of teachers with a grain of salt.

[My cousin Phanish's](https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/faculty/phanish-puranam) friend and former student once came to a barbecue Phanish was hosting - we got to talking and Phanish mentioned that [Reddi](https://www.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/9503/Reddi-KOTHA) worked on a paper predicting the success of companies based on the [kinship ties of the founding team](https://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/6497/).

These two papers seem like they're covering a similar topic - it's not just who you know, but who you are, and how close you are to the people around you that determines your success in an organization. The talented [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) made a fantastic visualization and playable simulation series around this idea called [the Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/).

In-group preference is predictable and somewhat baked into us, but so is the desire for novelty. Some research has been done into the [power of diverse teams](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter) - specifically that teams which bond over facts, and not some social identity, tend to produce more rational results.

What I love most about research like this is it reveals and validates
