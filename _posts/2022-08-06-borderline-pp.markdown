Predictive Processing is a fascinating framework, and you don't have to read all of _Surfing Uncertainty_ to understand it. It's best summarized as:

- Our mind is making simulations all the time
- Our mind is a hierarchy of simulation makers all the way from finger-movement to whole body movement to predicting the stock market
- Truth is arrived at via talk between layers of the hierarchy where sufficient bottom-up stimulus can override top-down beliefs
- Top-down beliefs often fuzz bottom-up data to make it make sense

Borderline Personality Disorder is defined by Wikipedia here. In my extremely uneducated opinion, there are overlaps with C-PTSD and NPD, so much so that I'm not convinced there isn't just one big diagnosis called Traumatized Personality Disorder.
