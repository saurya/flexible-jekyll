Looking back now, I thoroughly enjoyed my time in EF, even as the lockdown was looming over us and the economy began to disintegrate. Trying to talk to potential customers by pretending to be investors or clients or like _we already had a meeting and were running late_ was a thrill I have never really had before in life. It's the type of hustle I associate with the aggressive NJ types that I left behind in high school. It was fun.

Walking around the city, walking around the office answering emails was a far more engaging and active way for me to think than sitting at a desk. I found my thoughts flowed much more easily if I could get the blood pumping with coffee _and_ a little activity.

Once things started shutting down my partner and I would try to work from one of our homes, often choosing his since it was close to an amazing dumpling stall, he would always have watermelon sliced up and ready for the hot late afternoon and we could drink his instant decaf and relax as we bounce ideas off of each other.

Those muggy afternoons researching the use of satellite imagery or fluid dynamics software in various industries ranks high in my recent memory.

In that sense, doing a start-up was everything I always wanted it to be - total autonomy, fast-paced pursuit and invalidation of ideas, research into lots of different areas, and perhaps most importantly - building a really, fun intellectual relationship with another person.

I miss talking to my co-founder about whatever - in-between the watermelon and dumplings, we talked about his work modeling tsunamis, fluid dynamics in general, machine learning, video games, political philosophy. The business we were building was a focal point, but there was a lot more worth exploring out of the field of view. If I could have a few more experiences like EF, where I run into a few more people like Alex from all over the world, in different disciplines, I would count myself an extraordinarily lucky man.
