Nucleya's [Akkad Bakkad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mVFS8suPb0) was probably my first desi dubstep experience all those years ago. Since then, Nucleya has had quite an illustrious career working with a lot of famous names as well as indie musicians.

[Bass Rani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=slNebO7Yips) is quite fun with really beautiful female vocals. [Heer] also has some pretty nice vocals - it's a poem based off of [one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heer_Ranjha) of the romances of Punjab. If you want a real tear-jerker for ~10 minutes listen to [this non-electro rendition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrPvQvbp3Cg) of [another of the tragic romances of Punjab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sohni_Mahiwal).

Nucleya collaborated with a Tamil mainstream artist Benny Dayal to make a [better version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVYQOW2CIDw) of [Let's Nacho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GQX3GWcUmk). He collaborated with a Tamil folk artist, Chinna Ponnu whose [Sendhura Pottuvatchu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEsrM0JI9SA) is also a song I've put 100+ listens into. She's something of an icon in Tamil music land, among other contemporary acts like [Anthony Dassan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP4xqXaJI9I).

Ritviz dabbles in some electronic sounds, but is a bit of a stretch to call dubstep. Still has plenty of enjoyable tracks, including this very [cute video with some uncles dancing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gosur3db5I).

SomeWhatSuper is a Pakistani duo who tear it up with pretty much everything they release. [Bandook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mZnC60RonY) _fucking slaps_. [Sher-e-Balochistan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJrLTLM-PsU) _also slaps hard_.

Bollywood has taken the step towards much more wub wub - [remixing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLS4wyeano0) the classic [Tu Cheez Badi Hai Mast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8iIuK8JgCo), the 'original' iconic for both Akshay Kumar's hypnotic gyration and the fact that it was a melody copy of the [Nusrat classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwWlqf2b0k) about a [Sufi saint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lal_Shahbaz_Qalandar). Nowadays a lot of songs feature some electronic drop and honestly I'm too old to figure out if that means it is dubstep or deep house or dark wave or whatever.

Overall, I have a soft spot for soft vocals + dubstep. Something about the pacing of SomeWhatSuper's [Uth Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJj5bONlYZ0) is just pregnant with tension. It's done really well and I've listened to it 100+ times, easily. I eagerly await for the next thali of desi dubstep for me to gorge myself on.
